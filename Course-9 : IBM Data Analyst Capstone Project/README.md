## About this Course
The final course in the comprehensive program is a capstone project testing the learnerâ€™s newly acquired data analytical skills.

The course has six modules:
-	Data Collection
-	Data Wrangling
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Data Visualization
-	Building a Dashboard
-	Final Assignment: Present Your Findings

The capstone project unfolded in three distinct phases, centering around data pertaining to the IT sector. In the initial segment, I undertook a rigorous assessment of my data analytical and visualization capabilities using Python. Employing standard data analysis procedures, I commenced with data collection via APIs, proceeded to data wrangling, and conducted exploratory data analysis. This phase culminated in the generation of various visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Transitioning to the second phase, I constructed a dashboard within IBM Cognos Analytics, adhering to provided instructions. This segment presented a unique challenge as it required grappling with more complex instructions not covered in the course, prompting a more independent problem-solving approach.

Concluding this capstone journey, the final phase required me to translate the data analyses into a cohesive PowerPoint presentation. This process involved distilling meaningful insights from visualizations, articulating key findings, and unveiling their broader implications. Despite the considerable length and complexity, this project served as a fulfilling conclusion to the program, enabling the practical application of acquired skills in a real-world context.

The completed Jupyter Notebooks, the Cognos Dashboard and the PowerPoint Presentation is provided in this folder.
